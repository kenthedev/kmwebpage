Momentum is a puzzle-strategy game where movement is the player's greatest weapon. Strategize, deliver combos, and build up enough momentum until no monster can stand in your way!

Completed over 10 weeks, I was primarily responsible for programming our level system, which was based on a hexagonal grid. In addition, I setup a frontend level editor for our designers to place various hex types and assign enemy positions. My final contributions were a dynamic audio system, that would heighten or slow down the pace of the music based on player interaction, in addition to several audio tracks I produced.
