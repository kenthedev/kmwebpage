AR Maze Game is an AR Unity application for Android devices. It was made in a team of three using Vuforia Engine for image targeting in Unity 2019.2.15f1, as a prototype for the VRIM100: Digital Media course at Drexel University with Valentina Feldman.

In the game, the player can scan specified target cards to display in AR a maze that they must roll a ball through using touch controls. 

I worked on the project as a gameplay programmer, integrating the image target system using Vuforia's target manager. I also created both physical and digital mazes for playthrough.
