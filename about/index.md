<center><a href="https://kendalmitchell.com"><b>Kendal Mitchell</b></a> is a software developer specializing in building immersive experiences.</center>

## Welcome!
Hi, I'm Kendal! I'm a senior at Drexel University studying Computer Science and Game Programming.

I believe games hold the unique ability to connect with people on levels other storytelling mediums can't always reach. As a longtime fan of RPGs and fighting games, I hope to one day create experiences that resonate with others how these have for me. I'm currently working on my own third person shooter!
