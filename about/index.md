## Hey there, I'm Kendal.
<br>

<p>I'm a web, game, and software developer who's able to find success not only independently, but with a team too. I'm highly adaptable and consistently maintain level-headedness in the face of challenges. I strive to find creative, yet pragmatic solutions to problems.</p> 

<br>
<center><b>I want others to feel empowered through the experiences I create.</b></center>
<br/>

<p>I believe games hold the unique ability to connect with people on levels other storytelling mediums can't always reach, no matter how small or short the experience.</p> 

<p>
As a child, I fell in love with the stories, music, and combat offered by popular series such as Final Fantasy and Street Fighter. I hope to one day create experiences that resonate with others that way these still do for me.
</p>

<p>Feel free to browse through some of my projects on this site as I continue taking steps to bring those dreams to life.</p>

When I'm not working or playing video games, you can find me with my violin, a book, or at a concert.

I'm currently working on my own third person shooter!
