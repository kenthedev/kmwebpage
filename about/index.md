## Welcome!
Hey there, I'm Kendal, a senior at Drexel University studying Computer Science and Game Programming.

<br><center><b>I want others to feel empowered through the experiences I create.</b></center></br>

<p>
I believe games hold the unique ability to connect with people on levels other storytelling mediums can't always reach, no matter how small or short the experience.</p> 

<p>
As a child, I fell in love with the stories, music, and combat offered by popular series such as Final Fantasy and Street Fighter. I hope to one day create experiences that resonate with others that way these still do for me.
</p>

I'm currently working on my own third person shooter!

Feel free to browse through some of my projects on this site.
